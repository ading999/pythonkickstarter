# VSCode
- Vast selection of plugins
- Great user interface
- Light weight but highly configurable
- Great for developing structured projects

# Jupyter Notebook
- Portable notebook files makes it easy to store and share code and results
- Great for ad hoc analysis
- Runs as a web service and accessible in browser
- Not so great at managing complex project directories

Note:
- VSCode also conveniently supports Jupyter notebook and allows you to edit notebooks and python files within the same workspace.
