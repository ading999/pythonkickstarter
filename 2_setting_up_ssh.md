# TODO: Look up what is SSH
# Why use SSH?
- In practice, your development or production environment is usually on a different server from your desktop computer
- SSH allows you to quickly and securely connect to different servers without typing passwords every time
- For example, you can connect to github and clone/commit to repos by adding your SSH key to your github account
# TODO
- Look up how to generate an SSH key and add that to your github account
- Test the SSH key works by creating a private repo and cloning it to local
