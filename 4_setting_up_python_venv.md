# TODO: Look up what is a python virtual environment
# Why use virtual environments?
- Widely used in the industry
- Allows you to keep multiple copies of python and their libraries on the same machine
- Isolates different python/library installations so they don't interfere with each other
- Allows you to lock down library versions or recreate identical environments
# Ways to create and manage python venvs:
- venv library
- conda/ miniconda
- I recommend venv as conda can at times get cumbersome
# TODO:
- Look up how to create a virtual environment with python3.6 or later using "venv" library
- Activate the environment
- Install commonly used python packages
- Type "which python" in commandline with our without the venv activated, do you see the python path change?

# Bonus:
- Look up virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines; do you see differences and similarities among them?
- Have you used Linux operating systems? So far they are the most friendly for development work as they have great software compatibility and package management.
- Look up CentOS as they are often used on enterprise servers
- You can intall VSCode on your own computer and use it to SSH into linux servers and write/run codes there. This is also great to know.
